This repo will hold the code for my refresher project:
I am basically going through all my old projects and applying what I learned in a multi-disciplinary website.
I used AI to help organize all my past projects into sections I can look at each week as a 'refresher' for the different coding languages. 
Notes.txt contains summaries of my past projects I worked on for my CS Major.

# CS Career Preparation Plan
- 4h reviewing previous projects
- 2h creating this plan
- 3/18/24 - talked with a cs worker in gov and decided to make a front end website first
- 3/20/24 - 1h - looking for front end building focused websites
- 3/20/24 - 2h - working on wix website
- 3/21/24 - .5h - working on wix website
- 3/22/24 - Put front-end website on hold; need $$ to run a website.
- 3/27/24 - 1h - revamp linkedin profile and set up pitch59 (needs more work)

## Week 1: Java Backend
- [ ] Implement a Json Serializer using GSON.
- Focus on: Serialization, GSON library.
- Backend - Java
- 2/26/24 - 1h Setting Up Gradle
- 2/28/24 - 2h designing DAO Factory and DAOs
- 2/29/24 - 1h creating DAOs and Models
- 3/2/24 - 1h Creating more DAOs and Models

## Week 2: AWS Lambda
- [ ] Create a test service called from AWS Lambda.
- Focus on: AWS Lambda, serverless architecture.
- CS 340 - Java
- 3/4/24 - 1h work on how to integrate lambdas to backend (try to have lambdas but still have a server?)
- 3/5/24 - 1h Achievements Request, Response, and Handler. (next service)
- 3/7/24 - 30min work on service and how to organize.
- 3/9/24 - 1hr finished one service operation. 

## Week 3: C Command Line
- [ ] Complete Lab 1 - Parsing command line and operations in C.
- Focus on: Command line parsing, C programming.
- Command Line (CS 224)
- 3/18/24 - 1h setting up server in c. (contemplating using a different language...)
  Note: I am in a cybersecurity class so I was a bit hesitant about making a server in C, as it isn't very secure. I did learn recently about firewalls, which basically filter all incoming packets based on either set specifications, known malicious IP address, etc. I looked into different firewalls and it seems like buisinesses usually buy or rent a firewall that they can set up and use. I might see about getting a free version, or set one up myself. 

## Week 4: C++ Automation
