This repo will hold the code for my refresher project:
I am basically going through all my old projects and applying what I learned in a multi-disciplinary website.
I used AI to help organize all my past projects into sections I can look at each week as a 'refresher' for the different coding languages. 
Notes.txt contains summaries of my past projects I worked on for my CS Major.
